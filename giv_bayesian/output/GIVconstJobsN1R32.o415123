An MPI process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your MPI job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.  

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          or-condo-c241 (PID 16673)
  MPI_COMM_WORLD rank: 0

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully

by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully
and correctly survive a call to fork(), you may disable this warning
by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.

Rank 0 finished parallel computation
Rank 0 finished processing forward sections. Now working on reverse sections....
Number of CPU free cores set to: 2 given that the CPU has 36 logical cores.
32 cores requested.
computational jobs per core = 156. For short computations, each core must have at least 20 jobs to warrant parallel computation.
Computations are not lengthy.
Rank 0 starting computing on 32 cores (requested 32 cores)
