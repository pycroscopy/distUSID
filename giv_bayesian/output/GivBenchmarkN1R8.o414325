--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An MPI process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your MPI job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.  

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          or-condo-c108 (PID 122524)
  MPI_COMM_WORLD rank: 4

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully
and correctly survive a call to fork(), you may disable this warning
by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.

Done creating all results datasets!
Among the 68096 positions in this dataset, the following positions need to be computed: [    0     1     2 ... 68093 68094 68095].
Each rank is required to work on 8512 of the 68096 (remaining) positions in this dataset.
Rank 0 will read positions 0 to 8512 of 68096
Rank 5 will read positions 42560 to 51072 of 68096
Rank 7 will read positions 59584 to 68096 of 68096
Rank 4 will read positions 34048 to 42560 of 68096
Rank 1 will read positions 8512 to 17024 of 68096
Rank 2 will read positions 17024 to 25536 of 68096
Rank 3 will read positions 25536 to 34048 of 68096
Rank 6 will read positions 51072 to 59584 of 68096
