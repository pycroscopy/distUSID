--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An MPI process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your MPI job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          or-condo-c07 (PID 71272)
  MPI_COMM_WORLD rank: 0

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully
and correctly survive a call to fork(), you may disable this warning
by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.

No mpi4py found or script was not called via mpixexec / mpirun. Assuming single node computation
Rank 0 - on socket with 32 logical cores and 122.42 GB avail. RAM shared by 1 ranks each given 32 cores.
Allowed to read 2053903 pixels per chunk
Max positions per read set to 64000
Consider calling test() to check results before calling compute() which computes on the entire dataset and writes back to the HDF5 file
ensuring that half steps should be odd, num_x_steps is now 250

Done creating all results datasets!
Among the 68096 positions in this dataset, the following positions need to be computed: [    0     1     2 ... 68093 68094 68095].
Each rank is required to work on 68096 of the 68096 (remaining) positions in this dataset.
Rank 0 will read positions 0 to 68096 of 68096
	This class (likely) supports interruption and resuming of computations!
	If you are operating in a python console, press Ctrl+C or Cmd+C to abort
	If you are in a Jupyter notebook, click on "Kernel">>"Interrupt"
	If you are operating on a cluster and your job gets killed, re-run the job to resume
