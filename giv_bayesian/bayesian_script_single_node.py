The next two lines must be left as is whether it is for single or multi-node computation.
There is a bug in the way numpy is linked with accelerator libraries in Unix based systems that can sometimes
cause multiprocessing / joblib to hang on numpy operations like dot. See these issues and links:
https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/parallel.html#bad-interaction-of-multiprocessing-and-third-party-libraries
https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/310
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5752

So, keep everything under if __name__ == 'main'
