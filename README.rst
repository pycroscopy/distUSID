mpiUSID
=======

MPI versions of popular classes in pycroscopy and pyUSID. 
The emphasis is to develop the ``pyUSID.Process`` class such that it continues to work for laptops but also works on HPC with minimal modifications to children classes.
Once certified to work well for a handful of examples, the changes in the class(es) will be rolled back into ``pyUSID`` and even ``pycroscopy``.
Code here is tested and developed on CADES SHPC Condo only for the timebeing.
